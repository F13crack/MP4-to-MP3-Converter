# MP4-to-MP3-Converter
This is a little python script which converts .mp4 files to .mp3 files.

USAGE:
Just run the program and enter the name of your MP4 file and in the second input field the name for the new MP3 file. 
(ATTENTION! the file you want to convert has to be in the same folder as the script!)
